# at-else-closing-brace-newline-after

Require or disallow a newline after the closing brace of `@else` statements.

```scss
@if (@a == 0) {

} @else if (@a == 1){ }
@else { }             ↑
/**     ↑             ↑
 * The newline after these braces */
```

The [`fix` option](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/usage/options#fix) can automatically fix all of the problems reported by this rule.

This rule might have conflicts with Stylelint's core rule [`block-closing-brace-newline-after`](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/block-closing-brace-newline-after) if it doesn't have `"ignoreAtRules": ["else"]` in a `.stylelintrc` config file.  That's because an `@else { ... }` statement can be successfully parsed as an at-rule with a block. You might also want to set `"ignoreAtRules": ["else"]` for another Stylelint's core rule - [`at-rule-empty-line-before`](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/at-rule-empty-line-before) that could be forcing empty lines before at-rules (including `@else`s that follow `@if`s or other `@else`s).

This rule doesn't have usual `"always"` and `"never"` main option values, because if you don't need special behavior for `@if` and `@else` you could just use [`block-closing-brace-newline-after`](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/block-closing-brace-newline-after) set to `"always"` or any other value.

## Options

`string`: `"always-last-in-chain"`

### `"always-last-in-chain"`

There *must always* be a newline after the closing brace of `@else` that is the last statement in a conditional statement chain (i.e. has no `@else` right after it). If it's not, there *must not* be a newline.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```scss
a {
  @if ($x == 1) {
    // ...
  } @else {
    // ...
  } width: 10px; // No @else after, so should have a newline
}

@if ($x == 1) {
  // ...
} @else if { } // Has @else after it, so shouldn't have a newline
@else { }
```

The following patterns are *not* considered warnings:

```scss
a {
  @if ($x == 1) {} @else {}
  width: 10px;
}

a {
  @if ($x == 1) {
    // ...
  } @else if {
    // ...
  } @else {}

  width: 10px;
}

a {
  @if ($x == 1) { } @else if { }@else { }

  width: 10px;
}
```

## Optional secondary options

### `disableFix: true`

Disables autofixing for this rule.
